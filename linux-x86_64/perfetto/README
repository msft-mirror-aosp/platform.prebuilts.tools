This folder contains prebuilts of Perfetto for use by developer tools in the AOSP tree.

To generate the binaries in this folder, the following steps should be performed:
1. Ensure that all shared_libs in Perfetto's Android.bp files are changed to static_libs
2. Add the option static_executable: true to the Perfetto Android.bp file
3. strip `binary` for all the binaries in this folder to reduce binary size.

TODO(lalitm): upstream the shared_libs and static_executable options where it makes sense,
figure out if we can strip during the build and script the building and copying (and
possibly stripping).
