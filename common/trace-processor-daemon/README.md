These are prebuilts of the Trace Processor Daemon used by the Android Studio
Profilers backend.

They should be built using Bazel's release config for each platform:
bazel build //tools/base/profiler/native/trace\_processor\_daemon --config=release

And will be bundled with the respective Studio release artifact.
