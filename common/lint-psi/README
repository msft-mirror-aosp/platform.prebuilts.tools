IntelliJ Core, UAST and Kotlin
------------------------------

Originally, we just downloaded snapshots of intellij-core itself from
https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/releases, like this:
https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/releases/com/jetbrains/intellij/idea/intellij-core/171.4249.32/intellij-core-171.4249.32.zip

The version number here, 171.3780.107, matches the IDE used in Studio,
defined in tools/idea/build.txt

However, when we added Kotlin support, it turns out that the Kotlin
compiler itself includes large portions of intellij-core (though thanks
to shrinking it was sometimes only partial classes). Since we need
the Kotlin compiler, we just turn off shrinking in the compiler build
and then drop in the compiler jar (which contains all of intellij-core).


Updating
--------

First, check out a copy of the Kotlin git repository:
$ git checkout https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin
(or to start a new branch, git checkout -t origin/master -b my-master)

Then switch to a compatible patch branch.

Currently:
$ git checkout master
$ bunch switch . 183

Verify that the file versions.gradle.kts has the line
    extra["versions.intellijSdk"] = <version>
and set <version> as necessary to match the one in tools/idea/build.txt

Then make sure to apply some extra patches to work around bugs
and to add some special methods used by lint:
$ git apply /path/to/kotlin-compiler-patch.diff (which is located in
this directory).

Next, build the Kotlin repository:
$ ./gradlew dist :plugins:uast-kotlin:jar

Then, back in this prebuilt directory, update the "build-version" property
in update.xml to refer to the version in tools/idea/build.txt.

Finally, run the update.xml script, pointing back to the Kotlin repository:
ant -f update.xml -Dkotlin_src_dir=$MY_KOTLIN_REPO_ROOT

The packaging script will extract code and update the intellij-core and uast prebuilts
in this directory. It performs a number of steps to do that, such as unbundling the
trove classes, replacing a platform icons class, etc.
