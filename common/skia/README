This is a temporary manual build of external/skia during the T timeframe,
since BUILD files have been added to skia (preventing us from injecting
our own) but do not yet support the use case of skia-grpc-server.
This was built by deleting all the BUILD files in external/skia and building
@skia_repo//:libskia.
Once we can build //tools/base/dynamic-layout-inspector/skia:skia-grpc-server
against external/skia again this should be deleted.
See b/202336345.
