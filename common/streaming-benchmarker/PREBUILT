The APK in this prebuilt directory can be rebuilt by building the
Android project in tools/adt/idea/streaming/streaming-benchmarker.

In order to keep sizes small, please build the release target
which will still use debug signing keys, but drastically shrinks
the size of the APK.

Build instructions:
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Select the release build as the active build
   (Build > Select Build Variant...)
3. Build the APK (Build > Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) > Build APK(s)
4. Copy the file from app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk to
   prebuilts/tools/common/streaming-benchmarker/streaming-benchmarker.apk
