This prebuilt is expected to be necessary only while the intellij
platform does not include the toml plugin as source; once it does, the
platform build should be adjusted to incorporate the included plugin,
and this prebuilt should be deleted.

The objects in this directory were extracted from a download of the
Toml plugin from
<https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8195-toml/versions>,
specifically (as of September 2021) version 0.2.155.4114-212 from
<https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8195-toml/versions/stable/136667>.
